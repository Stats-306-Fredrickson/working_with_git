# Github basics

Those who already have a GitHub account can go ahead, log in and skip the rest of the below steps.

1.  Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click on the "Sign up" button to create an account.

2.  Note: if you use your @umich.edu account, you should be eligible for [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
    giving you access to a ton of stuff, including a Github Pro account while you're a student.

    For those who already have an account, you can still activate the pack as long as you add your `.edu` email to the emails (not covered here).

Github is a hosting service for git repositories.
While it has many functionalities, the most important distinction is perhaps between *public* and *privat*e repositories, where the former can be seen by anyone, and the latter can be accessed only by the owner and hand-picked *collaborators*.

# Creating and using SSH keys

An [SSH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen) authenticates *you* with Github so you (and *only you*) can push from your devices.

Detailed instructions [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux){.uri}

## Creating the keys:

1.  Open the `Terminal` on your Posit Cloud

2.  Paste the following, **after replacing your email in the text**, and hit enter

    ```         
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

3.  Press ENTER if presented with something like this:

    `> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]`

4.  Enter a password when prompted.
    This is a password you'll need to push to GitHub from this device, so make sure you remember it.

5.  Copy and paste the following command:

    ```         
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

6.  Similarly: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

### Registering the keys with GitHub

1, Click on your profile icon on GitHub and select *Settings:*

![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-45016/mw-1440/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings-global-nav-update.webp){width="300"}

2.  Click on `SSH and GPH keys` on the left-hand side menu

3.  Click on the green `New-` or `Add SSH key` buttons

4.  Under "Title", give the key a name indicating the device, such as "Posit"

5.  Now go back to the terminal and enter the following command:

    ```         
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

6.  Copy the output without any spaces and newlines

7.  Paste it in the "Key" field and click the green "Add SSH key" button.

You should be able to push (that is, "upload") files from your `posit.cloud` instance to GitHub now.

# Git basics

`TODO: modify & add to prev. stuff`

`TODO: change editor to nano?`

## What is Git?

-   A **version control system** manages changes from multiple sources simultaneously.
-   A reasonable analogy: Google Docs with track changes turned on
-   Useful for groups working together to track changes to the software package and document why changes were made
-   We will use it to disseminate homework assignments, labs, and lecture materials.

## How does git work?

-   Creates a **repository** (a hidden directory/folder) to information about the history of files
-   When you make changes, you may **add** them to a **staging area**
-   When you like your staging area, you **commit** your changes.
-   Git stores the **differences** ("diffs") from the previous version to your new version.
-   You can **push** your changes to a shared repository for others to use
-   You can **pull** from a shared repository and **merge** the changes of others.
-   If there are **conflicts**, git will let you know and make you resolve them.
-   If you ever need to see what changed, you have the entire **history** of all changes to look at.

## Command line interfaces

While git has graphical interfaces, we will teach using a **command line interface** (CLI) for git.

In an CLI you have an **interactive** prompt where you type a command.
It might look something like this:

```         
$ command -o --options argument1 argument2
```

-   `$` is the prompt
-   `command` is what we want to do (e.g., `git`)
-   Optional flags have `-` or `--` in front and change behavior
-   We can tell what do with `argument1` and `argument2`. Some commands have no arguments.

## Some basic CLI commands

-   `cd`: Change directory.
-   `ls`: List files in current directory
-   `pwd`: Print working directory
-   `mkdir`: Make a new directory (folder)
-   `rm -r`: Recursively delete directories and everything inside (use carefully!)

## Git and the CLI

When interacting with git, we will use commands like this:

```         
$ git SUBCOMMAND -o --options ARG1 ARG2 ...
```

Some example subcommands will be `pull` to get updates, `log` to see the history, `add` to stage files, and `commit` to commit changes.

## Let git know who you are

```         
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"
```

## Getting a copy of the Stats 306 Repository

Materials for this course are hosted at **GitHub**, a popular website front end for git.
Our materials are stored in repository on github.

If you want to get a copy (outside of Posit cloud) **clone** the repository:

```         
$ cd LOCATION_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_REPO
$ git clone https://github.com/markmfredrickson/stats306_spring_2024.git
```

## Getting future updates

When we make changes to the course materials (this will be frequent! We like to tinker!), you can get updates:

```         
$ git pull
```

## Saving changes to our local repo

If you have made changes to your repository, you will be prompted to commit them before pullling:

```         
$ git status
$ git add FILENAME
$ ... perhaps other files ...
$ git commit -m "a note explaining changes"
```

## Graphical interface

We teach the command line interface for git because

-   It is convenient to show in slides
-   It is transferable to any environment where you would use git
-   It matches our recommended text book
-   It exposes the full power of git

<!-- But, you can also use a graphical interface in Posit Cloud -->
